# Olympic Performance Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the impact of economic development and urbanization on Olympic performance using interactive visualizations in a Shiny Dashboard. 

## Directory Structure

- **app.R**: Main Shiny app script for running the dashboard.
- **data**: Contains processed data files used in the app:
  - `Filtered_GDP_Per_Capita.csv`: GDP data.
  - `Filtered_Olympic_Medals.csv`: Olympic medals data.
  - `Filtered_Urbanization_Data.csv`: Urbanization data.
- **dataprocessing**: Jupyter notebooks for data preparation:
  - `Data_process_download.ipynb`: Downloads raw data from external sources.
  - `Data_process_filter.ipynb`: Filters and cleans the data.
  - `Data_process_prepare.ipynb`: Prepares and merges the data for visualization.
- **www**: Resources for the app, like images.

## Datasets

- **120 Years of Olympic History** (Kaggle): Athlete records from 1896 to 2016.
- **World Bank Economic Indicators**: GDP and other economic metrics.
- **UN Urbanization Data**: Urbanization rates from 1950 to 2020.
